# UntiedConvolution
For many people, ’Untied Convolution’ is a relatively strange name, but this is not a mathematical
concept that appeared recently. On the contrary, it appeared very early, even before the applications
of neural networks became widespread. In 1975, Kunihiko Fukushima first proposed the concepts
of untied convolution and pooling in his article ’Cognitron: A self-organizing multilayered neural
network’ [Fuk75], although these concepts were not called their present names at that time.
Later in 1980, Kunihiko Fukushima proposed tied convolution in the network ’NeoCognitron’
[Fuk80], which provided inspiration for the development of deep learning. In 1989, Yann LeCun
proposed the first modern CNN: LeNet [LeC15b]. Since then, the neural networks based on
tied convolution are the main research direction and concept of untied convolution faded out of
people’s vision gradually. But in recent years, people started paying attention again to this concept
and understanding the potential value of this method
